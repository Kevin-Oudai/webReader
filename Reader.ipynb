      "Chapter 14: Eggs Laid by the Red Flag\n",
      "Translator: May Wiggins  Editor: Efydatia\n",
      "Qin Guan’s roommates did not want to keep watching the show. They were bored and wanted to leave, but suddenly they backed up when they saw several people carrying a drum kit, a keyboard and two speakers to the stage.\n",
      "The performers were all well-dressed, and the lead singer was in olive green, looking like a soldier about to sing a military song.\n",
      "After they tuned up, the performers played the electric guitar as an opening prelude, and the auditorium instantly became vibrant. The lead singer said, “Hello everyone! This is Eggs Laid by the Red Flag.”\n",
      "“The sudden opening is actually not abrupt\n",
      "Now is the time and we know what to do\n",
      "The red flag is still fluttering without direction\n",
      "The revolution is still alive, and the old chaps are getting more active…”\n",
      "The lead singer had a hoarse voice as if he’d been smoking too much. It actually made him sound like the perfect rock and roll singer.\n",
      "The boys in the audience were cheering. Hands held high, they followed the rhythm and started to rock together.\n",
      "Qin Guan and his roommates stood up as well. Liu Xiaoyang even jumped onto his chair. When the song was finished, the audience was fully pumped up.\n",
      "Rock and roll was a code those days. Everyone had a soldier in their heart. People would fight hard for their dreams and future with indomitable will.\n",
      "It had grown colder at the end of October. Qin Guan put on his jacket and set off for his first official tutoring class with Huang Jiajia. At 6:30 p.m., he showed up at the door of Huang Jiajia’s home. When he walked into the house and saw Huang Jiajia sitting by her desk, he was shocked.\n",
      "Her hair was not red anymore. Instead, it was black and shiny, dangling down her shoulders in two braids. She was not wearing any makeup either. This was the first time Qin Guan had seen Huang Jiajia with no makeup on. He recalled the first time he had seen her. She’d had thick eyebrows and big eyes, and her dark, dense eyelashes had looked like two tiny brushes. Her lips had been painted thick and red, making her look totally flamboyant. Yet now she was wearing a long pink T-shirt with a round collar and a pair of brown overalls. She looked like a good girl and a studious student.\n",
      "Qin Guan did not say anything. Giving her an encouraging smile, he opened the textbook and started the class at an appropriate speed, “Here it means… Yes, call by value from here.”\n",
      "During the whole class, Huang Jiajia listened to Qin Guan carefully without any complaints.\n",
      "When Qin Guan finished the class for the day, Huang Jiajia grimaced and said, “Mr. Qin, what did you think of my performance today? I’ll work even harder.”\n",
      "Qin Guan was glad. This would help him make money much more easily. He had 4 hours of class a week and he would get paid 50 yuan per hour, so every month he would make 800 yuan just by tutoring Huang Jiajia.\n",
      "Qin Guan did not show his joy. As he walked out of the house, he told Huang Jiajia, “You need to keep it up. One good performance doesn’t mean anything. Perseverance is what’s important.” Then he closed the door and left. He was quite busy. He had a kebab appointment with Wang Lei, and the next morning they would go to the China World Mall.\n",
      "Beijing had been expanding gradually with economic growth. Business areas were various systems formed amid that expansion, and Wangfujin and Xidan were among the earliest ones in Beijing. The China World Mall was an emerging, vibrant business area that had become the home of many new industries and fashionable brands, such as Motorola and IBM.\n",
      "Qin Guan and Wang Lei were currently at the foot of the China World Towers, the very center of the China World Mall. The two boys had seen the ad of a company on the CUFE billboard, and that was why they had come here. The ad had been different than the rest, which was why it had aroused their interest.\n",
      "Qin Guan and Wang Lei took the elevator to the consulting company on the 10th floor. The receptionist led them to a meeting room, where they saw a lot of people their age. Qin Guan believed they were also students applying for the part-time job.\n",
      "When everyone was seated, a supervisor came into the room and handed out material to each of the young students.\n",
      "The business of the consulting company was quite interesting. It helped retailers and traders of fast moving consumer goods find part-timers and sales promotion staff. It also did market research for some companies. This kind of business met the demands of foreign companies entering the Chinese market, thus consulting companies had become quite popular at the time. The company Qin Guan had visited was one of the oldest and the best in Beijing.\n",
      "Qin Guan and Wang Lei read the material carefully. The positions included supermarket promotion specialists for sodas and snacks, and staff for a wine shop. Qin Guan noticed that these jobs were all on weekends, from 10 a.m. to 12 a.m. in the morning and 2 p.m. to 5 p.m. in the afternoon. Wages would be paid daily in accordance with the standard rules, and the payment for the sales promotion staff was 50 yuan per day. The wine shop staff would get a daily payment of 100 yuan. Of course, those employees were required to have a good image and figure. There would also be an interview for the job.\n",
      "Qin Guan pursed his lips. The wine shop staff was the highest paying position among the three, although the payment was only as much as his tutoring fees. Half a loaf of bread was better than none though after all, so he decided to go to that interview. Wang Lei asked the supervisor, and he unexpectedly got a part-time job as a telephone researcher. From that day on and every weekend, he would work in the company as a telephone salesperson.\n",
      "When the two boys walked out of the meeting room, Qin Guan told Wang Lei curiously, “You have a sharp mind for business. Why are you studying accounting?”\n",
      "Pushing his glasses up, Wang Lei asked back, “You are so handsome, why do you study at CUFE?”\n",
      "They both laughed. They parted at the corridor when Wang Lei was taken by the supervisor to the office of the telephone sales personnel. Qin Guan and several girls were taken to another office, where the interview would take place. Qin Guan was the only boy in the group. Curious about why a boy would apply for that position, the girls chatted and laughed among themselves. Qin Guan felt helpless. “Fine, I know this is something new, but you shouldn’t stare at me like I’m a monkey. Yes, I mean you. Don’t point your fingers at me!”\n",
      "Qin Guan was feeling quite awkward when the door suddenly opened. Three elegant interviewers took a seat at the table. Qin Guan applied for the promotion position of Grand Bateau, a kind of middle-end wine imported from France.\n",
      "The promotion staff would serve the wine at exhibitions around Beijing. It was not cost-effective for exhibitors to hire professional models for the promotion, so the wine agent had come up with the idea of picking several college students for the job.\n",
      "The last interviewees had not impressed the interviewers. They thought college students had no working experience and their age did not match the maturity of the wine.\n",
      "The Chinese name of the wine was Longchuan. A general had made that particular wine for Napoleon, his leader during the Napoleonic Era. The wine was not expensive, but it had a dignity and elegance to it, so it was usually hard for college students with no experience to convey its connotation.\n",
      "The interviewers seemed a little bored. In low spirits, they said, “Next.”\n",
      "It was Qin Guan’s turn. When he stepped forward, the interviewers sat up instantly. Although they did not know about Qin Guan’s temperament, they were all captivated by his face.\n",
      "They asked him some basic questions, including his college and age, and Qin Guan took his time in answering every single one, not showing any nervousness.\n",
      "The interviewers exchanged a look and told Qin Guan to move two steps forward. They noticed that he was neither overbearing nor servile. They nodded and told him, “Good. Take this blank resume, go to the third room on the left and give it to the director of the exhibition.”\n"

      "Qin Guan took the blank resume and bid the interviewers goodbye with a nod before pushing the door open and leaving the interview room. When he opened the door of the third room on the left, he saw a big glass wine table in the center with several goblets and two bottles of open Bateau on it.\n",
      "There were already several tall fair ladies standing orderly by the desk next to the glass table. At the other end of the room, an old frowning tailor with a tape around his neck was measuring the size of a woman.\n",
      "An assistant with freckles standing by the door saw Qin Guan walk into the room with a blank resume. She had a bundle of pens in her hand, and she handed one to Qin Guan. Pointing at a small round table at the corner of the room, she told him, “Yes, second round of interviews. Fill in the resume over there and then give it to me. I’ll give you a number tag. Then you can go to the desk and wait for the final interview with the sales director.”\n",
      "Qin Guan moved the pen around in his hand. He was surprised to find that there was a third round of interviews after this one. “The final round? Why is this so complicated? It’s a part-time job after all,” he told the assistant.\n",
      "The assistant’s face turned quite serious. It seemed as if this was an important task to her as she explained to Qin Guan, “We’re recruiting short-term part-timers because we don’t have much time to prepare. We have no choice. Vinexpo China is next week, followed by the China International Wine and Spirits Exhibition. They’re both well-known exhibitions in China. We have to take this seriously.”\n",

      "Chapter 15: The Bateau Interview\n",
      "Translator: May Wiggins  Editor: Efydatia\n",
      "Qin Guan was amused by the serious look on the assistant’s face. He nodded at her and walked to the round table.\n",
      "The assistant covered her flushed cheeks as she thought to herself, “This boy is so cute when he smiles. He will probably pass the interview.”\n",
      "Qin Guan filled in the resume carefully on the table. Although he knew that he might not match the taste of wine, he had to take the second round seriously. The assistant had told him so.\n",
      "After filling in the resume, Qin Guan handed it to the assistant and got the number eight plate from her. Then he went to the desk and joined the queue.\n",
      "He stood at the end of the queue, waiting quietly for his turn.\n",
      "Some girls passed the interview and others failed, but those who failed did not look sad. It was probably because this was only a part-time job.\n",
      "Soon, it was Qin Guan’s turn. The sales director was a woman in her forties. Qin Guan smiled at her and put his plate on the table.\n",
      "The sales director was surprised. She pushed up her glasses, thrilled to see a boy applying for the job. As a matter of fact, she had been a bit angry, because most interviewees had not lived up to her expectations.\n",
      "Most wine customers were Chinese men, thus female shopping guides were good for wine promotion. However, recruiters should not ignore female customers or male customers with a different taste. If customers could not feel the connotation of the wine, no seductive woman could convince them to buy it.\n",
      "The interview had just gotten interesting. The sales director pulled her chair forward. Taking Qin Guan’s resume she said, “Qin Guan, right? Capital University of Finance and Economics. Good. I’ve got several questions for you. First, what do you know about wine?”\n",
      "Qin Guan was a bit dumbfounded. He knew a lot about beer and spirits, because he’d drunk a lot of them when he’d been an equipment salesperson in his past life. However, he knew very little about wine. According to traditional Chinese table culture, businessmen or politicians usually ordered spirits. Wine was considered a finishing drink for a meal. Therefore, Qin Guan had never studied wine brands before. He only knew about spirits such as Maotai and Wuliangye. He had never even ordered expensive spirits at a karaoke bar, because he’d rather spend the money on gifts for his business partners instead. As for western-style restaurants and wineries, he sure knew nothing about them.\n",
      "Qin Guan could only bite the bullet. He told the sales director, “I literally know nothing about wine.”\n",
      "The sales director looked a little disappointed. She went on to ask, “Have you ever drunk any wine before? What brand was it?”\n",
      "Qin Guan felt encouraged as he thought to himself, “I can do this! I don’t know much about wine, but I have drunk a lot of it.” He nodded at the sales director and said, “I’ve drunk a lot of wine, such as Changyu, Greatwall, Bordeaux, San Pietro… I must be forgetting some.”\n",
      "The sales director was shocked. She reckoned Qin Guan had to be an alcoholic if he’d drunk so much wine at such a young age. She pushed up her glasses again and asked, “Since you’ve drunk so much wine, can you go over there and have a sip?”\n",
      "Qin Guan nodded and said, “Okay.” He thought this would be quite easy for him. He walked up to the big glass table, picked up a bottle of wine and pulled the cork out. Then he took a goblet and poured some.\n",
      "At first, the sales director had been excited, but as she saw how Qin Guan had filled the goblet, she immediately covered her face. She could hardly bear the sight, but she had to watch Qin Guan’s next step.\n",
      "With a satisfied look, Qin Guan raised the goblet to his mouth. The sales director was feeling bored until she saw Qin Guan drink up the wine. Then a voice reverberated in her brain, “He drank it up in one go! Even an alcoholic would not have drunk wine like that!”\n",
      "Qin Guan took a deep breath and turned to the sales director with the empty goblet in his hand.\n",
      "The sales director was massaging her temples, wondering why that day’s interview was not going well. When she raised her head, she saw Qin Guan standing in front of the glass table with the empty goblet. He was standing against the sunlight, and the rays of light reflected on the glass table were shining on him. The rosy wine, the crystal goblet and the amber wine bottle made the scene before her look like an elegant painting.\n",
      "The sales director was dumbfounded. Qin Guan realized there was still some wine on his mouth, and he wiped it with his hand, ruining the harmonious scene.\n",
      "As if waking up from a dream, the sales director coughed awkwardly. Two voices were arguing inside her brain.\n",
      "One voice said, “Look at his coarse manners. He totally ruined the lingering effect of the wine,” while the second one said, “You can teach him how to sip wine. The scene you just saw proves his charm. Let him pass.”\n",
      "The sales director thought it over for over a minute before she told Qin Guan, “You have passed the interview.” Pointing at the tailor, she added, “Have your measurements taken over there. When you’re done, go to the small meeting room. You’ll receive a basic training there.”\n",
      "Qin Guan nodded and went up to the tailor. The sales director put his resume into the box tagged “Accepted” and moved on to the next interview.\n",
      "The old tailor did not talk much. When he finished measuring a female model, he waved at Qin Guan, gesturing for him to come over.\n",
      "Qin Guan walked up to the man and took off his jacket, leaving his weskit on.\n",
      "The tailor turned a page on his little notebook and began to measure him with a tape.\n",
      "Shoulder Width: 53 cm; Bust Size: 105 cm; Waist Circumference: 68 cm\n",
      "Abdomen Circumference: 85 cm; Hips: 100 cm; Thighs: 49 cm\n",
      "The tailor raised his eyebrows. The middle-aged man was not particularly eye-catching, but he was recognized as one of the best tailors in Beijing. He could not both design and tailor like a fashion designer, but he had made many clothes over the years for both starlets and fashion show models.\n",
      "“Gee, this young man is like a hanger!”\n",
      "Having not said a word for so long, the tailor finally asked, “Young man, how tall are you?”\n",
      "Qin Guan was putting on his jacket when he heard the man’s question. He smiled and replied, “183 cm. At least that was my height when I graduated from high school.”\n",
      "The tailor looked him up and down before he said, “You must be taller than that. Go measure your height over there.”\n",
      "Qin Guan looked at the direction the man was pointing at. There was a ruler for height measurement there. He nodded at the tailor, “Okay.”\n"

      "Qin Guan stood straight against the wall as the tailor moved close to the ruler, standing up on a stool. He pressed down Qin Guan’s hair and read the ruler carefully, “As I said, you’re taller than that.” He patted Qin Guan on the shoulder as he said, “Good. You’re 185 cm, not 183. You’ve grown taller.”\n",
      "Qin Guan did not know why the tailor had asked him to measure his height. He nodded at the man and wrote down his name and cellphone number on the small notebook just like he was told.\n",
      "Looking at Qin Guan’s back, the tailor picked up his notebook, thinking to himself, “Even male models hardly ever have such a perfect figure.”\n",
      "Qin Guan, of course, was unaware of the tailor’s thoughts. He just believed growing taller was a good thing. In his past life, he’d also been strong and brave, but he had not been tall enough. His muscles had made him look short.\n",
      "Qin Guan opened the door and walked into the meeting room. There were already three girls waiting inside. The girls went dumb when they saw that it was a boy coming in. When they recovered, they started chatting and laughing merrily.\n",
      "A member of the training department was pouring wine into glasses at the table and giving each interviewee one glass. Qin Guan and the girls waited for a while, but nobody else come in. The woman from the training department clapped her hands and said, “Today you will be trained here. I’ll give you a fast training course. Each of you will get material about this brand after the training. You can read it at home to get the general idea.” She picked up a glass of wine and moved it under the light as she said, “During the exhibition, you can’t wear perfume or cosmetics with a strong smell. You aren’t allowed to smoke either. Now let’s move on to the wine-tasting. Step one, observe the color and luster. If turbidity, sediment or suspended solids are found, the wine is disqualified. Of course, no such thing will be found on the wine at the exhibition.”\n",
      "“Step two, smell the fragrance. Pick up your glass and move it three centimeters away from your nose. Breathe in its smell through your nostrils. Remember, don’t exhale. Just inhale the wine. Don’t do it for too long, though. If you can’t distinguish the smell, shake the glass and smell it again.” The trainer shook her glass lightly.\n",
      "Qin Guan used his amazing memory again, keeping every instruction of the trainer in his mind.\n",
      "“Step three, taste the wine. Wine has five different tastes: sour, sweet, bitter, spicy and puckery. When you taste it, take a sip of about five milliliters. As staff, you need to experience the whole tasting process for your customers. You can also guide the customers on how to have a taste themselves.”\n",
      "The trainer poured wine into a glass and held the base of her glass with her thumb, index finger and middle finger. Tilting the glass away from her at a 45-degree angle, she shook the glass in her hand and moved it in a circle parallel to the table.\n",
      "Then she added, “You can move it clockwise or anticlockwise as you like.” Qin Guan saw the wine leave several traces on the inner wall of the glass after being shaken.\n",
      "The trainer moved the glass to her nose and smelled it near the rim before taking a sip. She kept the wine in her mouth, tasting it repeatedly as if she was chewing on it so the fragrance could diffuse in her mouth. After going through all the steps, she finally swallowed the wine.\n",

      "Qin Guan had just realized how he had behaved at the interview. He still preferred his old ways and believed such a process was too complex, but luckily, he had already memorized the three steps, so there was no need for him to worry.\n",
      "The trainer finished the demonstration by saying, “Tasting wine is just like tasting a cup of tea. Some things can be ignored, but the right mood has to be maintained. You’re not cattle drinking water from a ditch after all.”\n",
      "The trainer’s words had struck Qin Guan. Taking the material, he walked out of the meeting room in dismay.\n",
      "When Qin Guan and the girls walked out, the assistant gave each of them a small note. The assembly location and meeting time were both written on it.\n",
      "Qin Guan folded the note and went to see Wang Lei. When he reached Wang Lei’s office, he saw a pile of questionnaires on the table in front of his roommate. Qin Guan picked one up from the table and asked in an exaggerating tone, “You did all these this morning?”\n",
      "Wang Lei hang up and answered inadvertently, “Yep! I’ll get paid depending on how many I complete. This job suits me well!”\n",
      "Wang Lei wanted to make hay while the sun shined, so Qin Guan had to go back on his own. Taking a look at his watch, Qin Guan dragged Wang Lei off to have lunch with him.\n",
      "At the time, the China World Mall was one big construction site. Foundations were being dug and new buildings were being constructed, dust swirling in the air all around the Mall.\n",
      "The two boys believed that western-style food required complex table manners, and a buffet at a hotel was too expensive. There were very few dining choices for them.\n",
      "Qin Guan knew from his past life that there was a snack street in the area. He led Wang Lei to a small alley which had not been torn down yet, and pointed at the restaurants there. Like a rich man, he said, “What do you wanna eat? Pick anything you like. It’s my treat!”\n",
      "Wang Lei did not pretend to be courteous. Seeing so many restaurants there, Chongqing delicacies, Shaxian delicacies and Lanzhou hand-pulled noodles included, he pursed his lips. He knew the food there would be very cheap.\n",
      "Finally, the two boys decided to eat at a Xinjiang restaurant. After they got their seats, they asked for a Big Plate Chicken, two baked Xinjiang pancakes and a bowl of Shanxi Torn Noodles.\n",
      "When the Big Plate Chicken was served, the two boys found that it was worth its money. It was a huge round plate with a thick layer of snow-white Shanxi Torn Noodles covered in sauce-dipped chicken, potatoes, onions and green peppers, served with red chili and numbing Sichuan peppers. The dish really aroused their appetite.\n",
      "Holding the baked Xinjiang pancakes in their hands, they started gorging themselves on the Big Plate Chicken.\n",
      "When the check came, it was only 32 yuan. Qin Guan wiped his mouth and bid Wang Lei farewell before he headed back to school.\n",
      "In the evening, he went to Huang Jiajia’s house for their lesson. Lest the exhibition made him late for his tutoring, he asked for a day off and told her next week’s class would be postponed.\n",
      "Huang Jiajia was curious, and she asked Qin Guan why he was putting off their lesson. Qin Guan did not intend to keep his part-time job a secret, so he told her all about it.\n",
      "Huang Jiajia said she fully supported her teacher in his part-time job. She said postponing the class was totally fine with her, and Qin Guan did not need to worry about her studying. Qin Guan expressed his deep gratitude for Huang Jiajia’s support.\n",
      "The class ended in a friendly atmosphere, but Qin Guan did not know that as soon as he left, Huang Jiajia started giggling like a little fox who’d just stolen a chicken.\n",
      "Back at his dorm, Qin Guan called Cong Nianwei and told her about his part-time job next week. He sincerely asked for a day off and apologized for not being able to see her at Tsinghua University.\n",
      "Cong Nianwei did not complain on the phone, which upset Qin Guan a lot.\n",
      "The next day, while Qin Guan was in class, his phone vibrated. He took a look at the number and decided to reject the call. When the class was over, he called the number back. The receptionist on the phone gave Qin Guan an address in her sweet voice and told him to try on the clothes on site.\n",
      "Qin Guan wrote down the address and checked what classes he had in the afternoon. He had enough time, so he decided to go there after his classes were over.\n",
      "During his afternoon class, Qin Guan kept wondering how the clothes had been made so fast. He had just had his measurements taken a day ago after all.\n",
      "As soon as the class was over, Qin Guan hurried to the address he’d been given.\n",
      "At 5 p.m., Qin Guan pushed open the glass door of a clothes customizing shop at Xidan. The receptionist took him to the tailoring room. He had come so late that he was the only one there.\n"

      "The tailor was busy with his molds when he saw Qin Guan come in. He nodded at him, suggesting that Qin Guan to go to the fitting room and put on the suit provided by the wine trader for the exhibition.\n",
      "Qin Guan took the standard, dark grey, three-piece suit and a white shirt with the label still on. He walked into the fitting room and took all his clothes off except his underpants before he put the suit on.\n",
      "The suit looked good. There was no brand mark on it or on the white shirt provided by the exhibitor. The shirt looked brand new, as of it had been bought for an emergency.\n",
      "Qin Guan buttoned it up and put on the suit jacket casually before he walked out of the fitting room.\n",
      "The tailor was busy with his work. He pointed at a mirror without even taking a look at Qin Guan, and said, “Go to the dressing mirror and have a look. Tell me if you have any questions.”\n",
      "Qin Guan went to the dressing mirror as he was told. Looking into the mirror, he was a little bemused. He had seen himself in a mirror many times, but he still felt like a star every single time. It seemed that he had just been born handsome.\n",
      "This was not his own narcissism speaking. The tailor, who had been staring at him, also seemed speechless. He wanted to see how Qin Guan looked so he could do tailor some clothes for him.\n",
      "The exhibitor had borrowed the suit from a renting store. It was an ordinary Givenchy, neither independently designed nor made by specially-assigned manufacturers. Still, this suit cost about 25,000 yuan.\n",
      "Bateau was a middle-end brand of wine, but it enjoyed a high recognition worldwide.\n",
      "The two brands were both from France, so the Givenchy dealer had agreed to lend the suit to the exhibitor for free.\n",
      "The tailor thought the suit fit Qin Guan really well. He wanted to make the pant legs a little narrower so Qin Guan would look even more sexy, but considering that simplicity, freshness, decency, and toughness combined with softness were the philosophy of Givenchy, he gave up on the idea.\n",
      "The tailor did not talk much about the suit. He just asked the assistant at the reception desk to cover the suit and wrapped up the fitting process.\n",
      "When everyone had left the store, the tailor opened his notebook to the place where Qin Guan’s measurements were written and read it carefully. Then he picked up the phone from the table and made a call.\n",
      "The call got through, and the tailor calmly said, “Hello, is that Xue Wanyi? I’m Old Liu. I’d like to recommend a model to you. No, not from a model agency. He’s a student doing a part-time job here… Let me tell you more about him…”\n",
      "They spoke on the phone for over five minutes before hanging up. Old Liu tapped the notebook in his hand and smiled. “Now it’s up to you, young man.”\n",
      "On the day of the exhibition, Qin Guan got up very early and for the first time in his life, he showed off shamelessly in front of the mirror.\n",
      "His roommates also washed and got ready to go to the exhibition to support Qin Guan on his new job. Wang Lei would only go for a while at noon though, because he had a part-time job as well.\n",
      "Qin Guan could not stop them from coming along, but he knew exactly what was on their minds. They were not going to the exhibition to support him, but to see the female staff working with him.\n",

      "The International Convention Center (ICC) enjoyed a very good location. People could access it very easily. The moment Qin Guan and his roommates got off the train, they saw the center bustling with people.\n",
      "The exhibition had not begun, so most people were staff of wine manufacturers. With the small note in hand, Qin Guan found the assembling place. His roommates followed him, and suddenly stopped blinking.\n",
      "Besides the three girls that had been there on training day, the wine dealer had hired two more female models from a model agency. Seeing their long beautiful legs, Qin Guan’s roommates could not help but drool.\n",
      "The director of the part-timers handed out an exhibition program to all the female models and gave everyone a few additional tickets.\n",
      "After giving the tickets to his roommates and telling them not to cause any trouble, Qin Guan followed the director to the exhibition hall.\n",
      "It was still early, so the exhibition was only open to staff. They all fetched their clothes from the director and went to the staff room to change. Qin Guan was the only boy there. By the time he got changed, all the girls had taken their places.\n",
      "The director saw Qin Guan wearing the suit and walking out of the fitting room towards the exhibition stand. He looked like a royal boy from Europe, vividly conveying elegance.\n",
      "He waved to Qin Guan and asked him to come over to the wine cabinet at the hall center, where a swivel chair, a wooden wine rack and several goblets could be seen, creating an appropriate wine-tasting atmosphere.\n",
      "Each member of the wine-tasting staff held a wine plate, on which several refined glasses had been put, waiting to pour wine into. They held the glasses close to their chests, arms or thighs and walked around the hall. If they saw anyone who seemed interested, they would get them a drink and lead them to the booth.\n",
      "Both wine and spirits were exhibited at Vinexpo China. The major goal of the exhibitors was to attract distributors and agents across China.\n",
      "The exhibition opened at 9 a.m. and all exhibitors were ready to promote their brands.\n",
      "If one passed the rotating ticket office at the entrance and walked through the square, they could see the central hall of ICC in the very middle. As distributors and agents from all over China entered the hall, a silent war started.\n",
      "Everyone was dazzled by the bright lights, colorful backgrounds, crystal wine glasses, the staff walking back and forth, and the graceful or bold music playing.\n",
      "The Bateau marketing man was embattled. He had a stack of leaflets in hand, and gave one to each potential customer. Five members of the wine-tasting staff had suffered yawl scratches to their thighs. Holding their wine plates in hand, they walked to different aisles in stilettos.\n",
      "Qin Guan’s roommates approached his stand as soon as they entered the hall. They pretended to care and suggested that they have lunch together right before disappearing into the crowd.\n",
      "Qin Guan straightened his collar in an effort to get more comfortable. The exhibition lights shined down on the wine cabinet, creating a beautiful image. It was too warm for him, though.\n",
      "Looking at the three-piece suit he was wearing and the cheongsam of the girls, Qin Guan could only sigh.\n",
      "Lots of visitors had entered the hall by 9.30 a.m, and many agents were standing in front of the booths, staring at the brands that interested them. If they wanted to know more, they would take a seat and talk about the details with the marketing personnel.\n",
      "The Bateau booth enjoyed a good location that attracted a lot of wine distributors to have a look.\n",
      "When the distributors and agents came close, they saw a young man in a dark grey suit leaning against the wine-tasting table at the central booth. The brown wooden rack held dozens of bottles of wine, and the light reflected by the crystal glasses formed a number of halos on the young man, creating a mysterious atmosphere.\n",
      "Seeing quite a few visitors approach his booth, Qin Guan immediately put on an elegant expression. Checking that Qin Guan was ready, the marketing man gestured for the visitors to look at him.\n",
      "The visitors turned to the wine-tasting table where Qin Guan was leaning, thinking to themselves, “Where does this young man come from? He looks like he has very good taste. Maybe he’s an old customer of Bateau invited here for the promotion?”\n",
      "If Qin Guan had known what they were thinking, he would have yelled at them, “Absolutely not! It’s just a part-time job, okay? A hundred yuan for the whole day!”\n",
      "The marketing man was thrilled, and he started to introduce the wine to the visitors in excitement. The agents were quite satisfied. They were convinced that the wine was high quality.\n",
      "After the initial communication, many distributors came to the wine rack where Qin Guan stood and tasted the wine with him before they left. Qin Guan used his amazing memory and put into practice what he had learned from his training teacher.\n"

      "When the agents saw Qin Guan’s smooth, graceful wine-tasting procedure, they were even more convinced that this brand was top quality.\n",
      "In just one morning, five agents from different cities had signed an initial agreement with Bateau. The marketing men were all thrilled and every single one of them would come and pat Qin Guan on the shoulders as they passed by.\n",
      "Qin Guan was not as excited as they were. It was too warm for him to be wearing a three-piece suit, so he decided to ask the director to allow him to at least take off the jacket.\n",
      "The director thought it over. Patting Qin Guan on the shoulder, he said encouragingly, “Okay. Can you keep it on just this morning? You know, the majority of the visitors are agents from different cities, and the Givency suit can fully convey our product’s philosophy. Could you please hold on for a little while?”\n",
      "Qin Guan was fully aware of the director’s feelings. Fortunately, it was almost noon time, so he just needed to put up with it for a short time.\n",
      "The Bateau booth was quite popular that morning, but at 11:40 a.m. all the working staff could finally take turns and take a rest. Qin Guan declined the takeaway ordered by the working assistant; instead, he went out with his roommates for lunch.\n",
      "Wang Lei had finished his morning work early and was waiting for them outside. The boys met, planning to glut themselves at Origus.\n",
      "Why did I use the word glut, you ask? Maybe the reader needs an explanation. Origus was a quite cost-effective pizza buffet restaurant.\n",
      "Students had a certain strategy when it came to glutting at ORIGUS. Before they went there, they would starve themselves until they were too weak to walk, so they’d have to walk in by supporting themselves with their hands against the wall. When they finished their meal, they would be so full that they’d also have to walk out by leaning against the wall.\n",
      "Qin Guan took off his suit jacket and hang it on a hanger in the lounge. He just wore his shirt and waistcoat to lunch, because he didn’t want to stand out too much.\n",
      "In order to celebrate his success at his part-time job, Qin Guan announced that he would get the check. The boys discarded all courtesy and went in first. The meal cost Qin Guan 168 yuan altogether. “Gee, this is cheap!” he thought. When he gave the receipt to the waiter, he saw that all his roommates had already started helping themselves. He took a seat, watching each of the boys holding a plate and stacking food on it. When they came back to the table, Qin Guan saw New Orleans roast chicken wings, roast drumsticks, barbecued pork and pork ribs seasoned with minced garlic on their plates.\n",
      "He told the boys calmly, “Can you please have some veggies?” They all answered, “How can we satisfy our appetite with veggies?”\n",
      "Qin Guan pursed his lips. It occurred to him that at the time, people did not know how to eat healthily. He could only fetch a plate for food and get himself a cup of juice.\n",
      "When he went back to the table, the chicken wings that had been piled up like mountains had all become chicken bones. As Qin Guan picked up a slice of pizza, he saw his roommates bring a second plate to the table.\n",
      "Qin Guan looked around and noticed that the waiter’s face had turned quite stern. He could do nothing but give them an awkward smile. In the blink of an eye, the boys had already brought a case of beer over and started their third round of eating.\n",

      "Qin Guan and Liu Xiaoyang held a chicken wing in one hand and a cup of juice in the other as they watched their roommates wine and dine. The two boys were thinking to themselves, “Drink as much as you like. You’ll finally make yourselves suffer.”\n",
      "It had only been half an hour since the boys had started eating, but the waitress had already cleaned the table twice. Feeling his stomach, Qin Guan stopped eating.\n",
      "Mu Lejiang was surprised to find that Qin Guan had not eaten that much. With a toothpick in his mouth, he said, “Come on, man!”\n",
      "Qin Guan answered helplessly, “I’d love to, but look at me! I can’t eat too much.”\n",
      "The boys took a glance at Qin Guan’s tight suit and waistcoat. They imagined how he would look if he got full. They all shook their heads and said, “You’re right, you can’t.”\n",
      "Qin Guan looked at his watch and decided to go back to the exhibition hall. He could not just sit there and watch the boys eat, so he bid them goodbye and went back. When he got to the hall, he did not put the suit jacket on again. The lights inside were so many that the temperature was up by 2-3 degrees Celsius because of the heat they generated.\n",
      "Qin Guan undid two buttons at the top of his shirt and rolled up his sleeves. When the director passed by and took a look at him, he nodded at the boy in satisfaction.\n",
      "Qin Guan did not know why the director had nodded at him until the afternoon session began. There weren’t just distributors and agents from all over the country. Wine and spirit collectors, bar owners and wine shoppers had also come to the exhibition. Even some citizens and media representatives had come to experience the foreign wine culture.\n",
      "Qin Guan relaxed. The director had gotten him a fashion magazine to read so he could recreate a casual style.\n",
      "Qin Guan took a seat on the high chair in a relaxed mood. From time to time, he would fill a glass and sip a little wine, enjoying his leisure time. All the other staff were glaring at him.\n",
      "Before Qin Guan could enjoy it to his heart’s content though, he heard a voice from behind him, “Mr. Qin! You’re here! I found you!”\n",
      "Qin Guan turned his head. “Gosh! What is she doing here?” It was Huang Jiajia.\n",
      "Qin Guan was surprised. “How did you know I’d be here?” he asked.\n",
      "Huang Jiajia looked at Qin Guan proudly and replied, “You told me you had a part-time job last time and would have to put off our class. I checked online and noticed that the only exhibition today was in ICC. That’s why I came here. I made it!” Huang Jiajia fanned herself with her hands. “Gee! It’s too warm in here. I’ll wait for you so we can go back together, Mr. Qin.”\n",
      "Qin Guan immediately put his hands together, raised them up and bowed. “Oh, my God! I’m begging you to go back home. Please don’t cause any trouble here.”\n",
      "Haung Jiajia looked upset as she said, “Why would I cause trouble? I’ll be a good girl, I promise. I just wanna wait for you here.”\n",
      "As Qin Guan and Huang Jiajia were talking beside the booth, another voice rang out from behind them, “Qin Guan, what are you doing here?”\n",
      "Qin Guan turned around. “Oh, my God! It’s Cong Nianwei!”\n",
      "Right away, he put his hands down and pretended to clean his shirt. He patted himself off and smirked. “Cong Nianwei! What are you doing here?”\n",
      "Cong Nianwei took a look at Qin Guan and the girl behind him, who was glaring at her.\n",
      "“I came to greet my high school classmate who works here. Is it a bad time?”\n",
      "“No, of course not. I was just surprised is all.”\n",
      "Cong Nianwei did not answer right away. She gave him a gentle smile before she said, “So why are you talking instead of working? Is this your new friend? Why don’t you introduce us?”\n",
      "Qin Guan was charmed by Cong Nianwei’s gentle smile. He stared at Cong Nianwei as he shook his head. “Oh, no. She’s my student. I asked her to go back home.”\n",
      "Suddenly, Huang Jiajia popped out from behind him. “I’m Mr. Qin’s student. Who are you?” She was upset by Cong Nianwei’s appearance, which had interrupted her conversation with Qin Guan. She felt that Qin Guan’s silliness was offending, so she decided to have a talk with this girl.\n",
      "Noticing that it was a little girl, Cong Nianwei was relieved. “You’re Qin Guan’s student, right?” she said in a soft tone. “He’s told me all about you. Nice to meet you.”\n",
      "Huang Jiajia got even more upset. The girl before her was truly pretty. She was nothing like her. She was really intelligent, gentle, and polite, while Huang Jiajia just looked like a cute girl with poor taste.\n",
      "Huang Jiajia was unhappy. “Yes. I’m Mr. Qin’s student. Aren’t you his high school classmate?” she said impolitely. “I’m waiting for Mr. Qin so we can go back together.”\n"

      "Cong Nianwei said nothing. She looked at Qin Guan as if she wanted to say something to him. Qin Guan suddenly realized what was happening between the two girls. Immediately, he explained, “Huang Jiajia, this is my high school classmate and potential girlfriend. If she accepts my request, she will become your teacher’s girlfriend.”\n",
      "Hearing this, Huang Jiajia somehow felt wronged. Tears filled her eyes, but she forced herself not to cry before Qin Guan and Cong Nianwei. Instead, she mumbled, “She hasn’t answered your request, but you’ve been such a coward. What’s so good about that?” Then she glanced at Cong Nianwei, bowed her head down, and stopped talking.\n",
      "Qin Guan did not yield to the strong, but he did to the weak. The fact that Huang Jiajia was in such low spirits made him feel sorry for her.\n",
      "Cong Nianwei take a look at Qin Guan and told Huang Jiajia, “Since you’re here, why don’t you look around until Mr. Qin can go back with you? He won’t miss your class.”\n",
      "Haung Jiajia raised her head. She felt that Cong Nianwei’s words were really offensive. As if she couldn’t stay with Mr. Qin unless Cong Nianwei approved it! Huang Jiajia held her handbag so tight she almost tore it apart. “I don’t need your pity!” she sobbed. “I’m going back now!” Then she walked out without even looking back.\n",
      "Qin Guan gestured at Cong Nian and followed Huang Jiajia, saying, “It’s better that you go back. I have work to do here. The afternoon session won’t be long though, so I’ll stick to my plan and won’t miss the class. I promise!”\n",
      "Haung Jiajia looked at Qin Guan as she laughed angrily. “Go back to your girl, you fool!” she said before she left.\n",
      "Qin Guan was confused. He had not expected Haung Jiajia to scold him under the circumstances. He could not figure out why she had.\n",
      "When Qin Guan returned to the booth, he found Cong Nianwei sitting on the resting chair, reading a magazine quietly.\n",
      "Delighted, he sat on the chair opposite Cong Nianwei and said, “Wait a minute, I’ll talk to the director and ask him to allow me to work around the hall.” Then he ran to the director to negotiate with him.\n",
      "It took Qin Guan quite a few minutes to persuade the director to grant his request. The director asked Qin Guan to take a pile of advertising posters and stick some brand logos on his face and chest.\n",
      "After checking that the logos were easy to stick and remove, Qin Guan asked the director for a few more as souvenirs.\n",
      "When he was ready, he took the posters and told Cong Nianwei, “Okay, let’s take a walk around the hall.” Cong Nianwei put down the magazine and walked with Qin Guan.\n",
      "They walked along the aisles of the hall. Qin Guan really stood out among the rest of the staff. Even though he was holding the posters in a causal way, he attracted people like a light bulb. Anyone interested would come up to him and ask for a poster, and Qin Guan would tell them where his booth was.\n",
      "After a while, Cong Nianwei told Qin Guan in an amused way, “Have you noticed it’s usually mature women who ask you for a poster?”\n",
      "Qin Guan looked at Cong Nianwei’s shiny black hair. He felt that something was off about what she’d said. In a short time, he had already handed out all his posters. Even the sticky notes in his hands were gone. Female customers had taken them to stick them to their faces and legs.\n",
      "As they walked back to the booth, the director came and patted Qin Guan’s shoulder in excitement. Qin Guan was puzzled. The director said, “Qin, you did a very good job! I’ll ask the cashier to give you 200 yuan.”\n",
      "Qin Guan looked at the director in bewilderment. The director pointed at the reception area, and Qin Guan saw some female customers who had asked for posters and sticky notes sitting there. Among the women, some were wine collectors and others were hotel managers. No matter how much the actual sale volume was, it had to be quite profitable for the exhibitor to win the approval of several luxurious hotels.\n"
